#Module 1: Containerization and Infrastructure as Code

In this module I learned:

   * Containerization the Postgresql database using Docker
   * Ingesting data to the database using Jupyter Notebook
   * Creation of a Cloud Storage and BigQuery Dataset using Terraform Code.
   * Setup VM on GCP and how to access it on your local machine using SSH Key
