# Module 3 : Data Warehouse

In this module I learned:

ETL pipeline and Data Warehouse built for the NYC Green Taxi Trip Record Data (2022), designed to unlock valuable insights through BigQuery on Google Cloud Platform.

Establish an ETL pipeline on Mage to process and export TLC trip data.

Successful creation of an ETL pipeline to load green taxi data into BigQuery.
Implementation of external table connections in BigQuery.
Design of partitioned tables based on pickup date for efficient data retrieval.
Utilization of locationID-based clustering to optimize query performance.
Analysis of query execution time to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
Further Exploration: This project serves as a springboard for further investigation into Data Warehousing and BigQuery
